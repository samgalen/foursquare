This is a project to finally compute the subgame perfect 
equilibrium of foursquare. 

There are a couple different components to this project:

	1. foursquare - defines the foursquare game

	2. gamegraph - algs to traverse gamestate digraph

	3. prodcon - backend producer/consumer queue to enable parallelism
